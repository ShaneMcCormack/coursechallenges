The first challenge set my the ‘Media’ section was the following:

Image Layout:

Create a page with two div containers, both containing an image, a <h2>, and a number of paragraphs.
Ensure the images have recommended attributes.
Give the images a width and height of 250px.
Place the image between the <h2> and the paragraphs.
Float one image to the left and the other to the right.
Ensure the <div>’s line up alongside each other in the page.

The second challenge was as follows:

Adding a Background Image:

Let’s return to the challenge of the previous lesson.
First, remove the following:

-The code which fixes the heading to the top
-The padding-top of the container
unit 4-9


Add a background image to the body of your page using CSS:

body{
/* background-image code here */
…
}
Try both cover and contain.
