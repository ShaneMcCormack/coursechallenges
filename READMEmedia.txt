The first challenge set my the ‘Media’ section was the following:

Image Layout:

Create a page with two div containers, both containing an image, a <h2>, and a number of paragraphs.
Ensure the images have recommended attributes.
Give the images a width and height of 250px.
Place the image between the <h2> and the paragraphs.
Float one image to the left and the other to the right.
Ensure the <div>’s line up alongside each other in the page.
